# TV-Shut-Up
Universal TV mute button

## Description
So maybe you're fine with the TV(s) being on, but you just want it to be quiet. Put this code on a standard TV-B-Gone
and it will solve this problem!

## Status
Initial commit and one code for some Samsung TVs

Other TVs may be added by following the design notes at [adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/tv-b-gone-kit?view=all#design-notes)

You may need to modify `DELAY_CNT` in `main.h` for the correct timings with your version of avr-gcc.
